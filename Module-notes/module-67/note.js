GET VS POST



The GET method requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using GET should only retrieve data.

The POST method submits an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in state or side effects on the server.


1.
-GET retrieves a representation of the specified resource.

-POST is for writing data, to be processed to the identified resource.

2.

-It typically has relevant information in the URL of the request.

-It typically has relevant information in the body of the request.

3.

-It is limited by the maximum length of the URL supported by the browser and web server.

-It does not have such limits.

4.

-It is the default HTTP method.

-In this, we need to specify the method as POST to send a request with the POST method.

5.

-You can bookmark GET requests.

6.

-It is less secure because data sent is part of the URL

-It is a little safer because the parameters are not stored in browser history or in web server logs.

-It is not cacheable.

8.
